# GridworldEnv-QTableLearning

### _A tiny 3x3 gridworld for Q-Learning._

### The environment looks like this:

|‚Äé|‚Äé|‚Äé|
| --- | --- | --- |
| [0,2] | [1,2] | [2,2] |
| [0,1] | [1,1] | [2,1] |
| [0,0] init | [1,0] üî•| [2,0] ‚≠ê |

### Rewards:

|‚Äé|‚Äé|‚Äé|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | -1 | +1 |

### Learned values with gamma = 0.9:

|‚Äé|‚Äé|‚Äé|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.66 | 0.73 | 0.81 |
| 0.73 | 0.81 | 0.9 |
| 0.66 | -1.0 | 1.0 |

## Sample episode
Here the __QTableAgent__ jeff was run with __gamma = 0.9__.
